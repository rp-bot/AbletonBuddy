\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This project presents a full-stack application designed to bridge the gap between natural language intent and digital music production.
The core objective is to develop a chat interface that translates specific user requests into Open Sound Control (OSC) messages to control Ableton Live in real-time.
Unlike standard mapping tools, this system utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) backend to interpret semantic intent (e.g., ``Make the drums punchier'') and execute the corresponding technical commands.
