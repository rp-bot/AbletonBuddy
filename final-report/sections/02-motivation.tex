The intersection of AI and creative tools is often hindered by the ``translation gap'' between human intent and software parameters.

The Efficiency Problem: Current state-of-the-art systems often rely heavily on generic protocols (such as MCP) or massive context injection to manage tool use.
This approach is computationally inefficient, resulting in high latency and excessive token consumption, both of which are unacceptable in a real-time creative environment like music production.

The Workflow Solution: There is a critical need for a system that does not rely solely on brute-force context.
Instead, we need a dynamic solution that leverages domain-specific heuristics, encoding the actual steps music producers take.
By mimicking the workflow of a producer rather than just the API of the software, we can achieve a higher degree of autonomy with significantly lower computational overhead.
