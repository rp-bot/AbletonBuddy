\subsection{Refinement \& Stabilization}

The current development phase focuses on system hardening. While the functional feature set is complete, continuous refinement is applied to improve response latency and handle edge cases in user intent. This stage prioritizes the resolution of bugs discovered during real-world usage scenarios and the optimization of the OSC message throughput to ensure a seamless, real-time user experience.
